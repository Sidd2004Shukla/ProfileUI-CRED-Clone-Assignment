# 📱 CRED Profile UI Clone - Internship Assignment

This Android project replicates the profile screen of the **CRED** app. It was built as part of an internship assignment and demonstrates the ability to design clean and functional user interfaces using **Kotlin** and **XML layouts** in **Android Studio**.

The design includes user details, credit score, cashback stats, rewards, and transaction options – matching the layout shared in the assignment brief.
